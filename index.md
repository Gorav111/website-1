# About me

I am a GIS software engineer, working as a PhD candidate at the 3D geoinformation group of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.

My PhD topic is the development of a 4D data structure for the representation of multiple versions of 3D city models. My other research and professional interests are versioning (i.e. let's apply git everywhere :-) ), 3D graphics, GIS and CAD software development.
